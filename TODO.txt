Game Rules
    Very modified:
        Can only play each zone once per turn (prevents boring semi-safe fusions)
        Can play a max of 8 stars from hand per turn
    Slightly modified
        Can only play one card/fusion per turn (same as original)
        [MAYBE] Total levels of cards in the deck can't go over a certain value
            Provavelmente é desnecessário, já é melhor usar cartas com atk 0 pra fazer fusões rápidas
    Only monsters with atk<=3000 and def<=3000 can go into the main deck (the rest can only be obtained through fusion)
    Rest are Forbidden Memories rules
